# MultipleFolderScript
A script that adds a selection in the windows context menu that allows users to create and name multiple folders at once.
# Warning!
Please be sure to backup the windows registry or create a restore point before running the script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x should be installed on your system.
  

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Update the `python_exe_path` and `script_path` variables in the script to match your Python installation and script location.
3. Execute the script either by double-clicking on it or running it from the command prompt.
4. The script will prompt you to enter the number of folders you want to create and their names.
5. After providing the folder names, the script will create the specified folders in the selected directory.

## Security Considerations

Adding context menu entries can affect your system's behavior. Only add context menu entries from trusted sources.

## Restore Instructions

To remove the context menu entry added by the script, you can delete the corresponding registry key or restore your system using the previously created backup.
